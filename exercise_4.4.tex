\def\bs{\char`\\}
I think Knuth chosed the names `{\tt\bs tenpoint}' and `{\tt\bs tenrm}', etc.,
instead of `{\tt\bs10point}' and `{\tt\bs10rm}', because \TeX\ interprets
`{\tt\bs10point}' as control sequence {\tt\bs10} instead of {\tt\bs10point}.
The same is true for `{\tt\bs10rm}' and other similar names.
