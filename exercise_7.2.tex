\def\bs{\char`\\}
\def\pl{\char`\{}
\def\pr{\char`\}}
I have no idea why Knuth decided not to make `{\tt\bs\bs}'
the control sequence for reverse slashes.
His decision is irrational and wrong.
Because of his decision I have to type
``{\tt{\bs}def{\bs}bs\pl{\bs}char`\bs\bs\pr}'' at the beginning of every big
document.

Maybe he just wanted to make me suffer.
